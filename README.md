# lightning-nowcast-model
This respiratory contains the lightGBM model and other processing codes supporting the findings of article "Lightning nowcasting with aerosol-informed machine learning and satellite-enriched dataset". The paper is currently in the preprint version:Â  https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2616886/v1

Due to the data storage limit of Github, we are not able to upload the full model (~65MB). We demonstrate here the trained model with simplified training parameters ('n_estimators':200, 'num_leaves': 200, 'max_depth': 8). It is strongly encouraged with the original setup of parameters refered in the manuscript.
